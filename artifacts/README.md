# Uncertainties

## 0. Knowledge in Machine Learning
We have just started learning about Machine Learning (ML) and may encounter difficulties along the way. Additionally, we are uncertain about which pre-trained model to use.

## False-Positive Recognition
Due to the lack of contextual understanding, the ML model might fail to detect certain toxic messages that should be classified as such.

## Data
We are still searching for an ideal dataset that includes contextual information about the match during which the messages were sent. This context is crucial for accurately detecting toxicity.

## Multi-Language Support
Toxicity might be expressed in different languages using various characters (e.g., "cyka"). This could pose a challenge for detection.

## Research Papers
We have gathered multiple research papers that analyze toxicity in gaming and explore different AI-based methods for detecting it.

- [A Review of Toxicity Detection in Online Gaming - QUT](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/227450/1/104448192.pdf)
- [Detecting Toxicity in Online Communities - arXiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18330)

## Datasets
We have identified some datasets from gaming environments, but we need to review them to assess the level of contextual information they provide.

- [CONDA: Context-Aware Dataset for Toxicity Detection - GitHub](https://github.com/usydnlp/CONDA)

## Dota 2 API
We have found the Dota 2 API and need to review its functionality and relevance for our project.
