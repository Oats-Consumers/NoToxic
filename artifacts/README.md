# Uncertainties

## 0. Knowledge in Machine Learning
We have just started learning about Machine Learning (ML) and may encounter difficulties along the way. Additionally, we are uncertain about which pre-trained model to use.

## False-Positive Recognition
Due to the lack of contextual understanding, the ML model might fail to detect certain toxic messages that should be classified as such.

## Data
We are still searching for an ideal dataset that includes contextual information about the match during which the messages were sent. This context is crucial for accurately detecting toxicity.

## Multi-Language Support
Toxicity might be expressed in different languages using various characters (e.g., "cyka"). This could pose a challenge for detection.
